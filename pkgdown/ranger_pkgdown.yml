  title: A fast implementation of Random Forests
  description: >
    A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high
    dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and
    probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide association
    studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of
    class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL') and 'dgCMatrix' (R package 'Matrix')
    can be directly analyzed.
